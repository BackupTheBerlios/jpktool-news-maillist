Subject: [Jpktool-news] jpktool 0.5.1 released
Message-ID: <200603090015.18861.jpktool@comhem.se>

0.5.1 2006-03-08
	Bugfix: jpktool would crash if you don't run current. Thanks H?kan.
	Bugfix: jpktool now chwcks if there is something to do before asking
		for your root password. Forgot that in 0.5.0
	jpktool -c do not work for now. That might be removed later. jpktool
		don't install anything anyway so you always have the opportunity to
		choose not to upgrade or install before jpkhandy starts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.5.0 2006-03-03
	--source is turned off in this version. It will propably be back in
		the next version.
	Config. jpktool will now search for jpktool.conf in /etc, /usr/etc and
		/usr/local/etc in that order.
	Rewrote jpktool again. The package now contains 2 programs jpktool and
		jpkhandy. jpktool is suposed to run as non-root and search for
		packages to update, install or remove. When that is done jpktool
		will ask for your root-password and start jpkhandy. jpkhandy does
		the downloading and installation/upgrading work. jpkhandy do not use
		pkgtools. They are built in.
	Removed WARNROOT. jpktool is now intended to be run as non-root and
		get root acces only when needed.
	Bugfix. If the package descripiton was not found jpktool would not
		tell you anything. Now it tries to download the package.txt file.
	Bugfix. jpktool only downloaded the slackware/PACKAGES.TXT.
